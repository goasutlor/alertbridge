All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Upcoming changes go here before release tagging. -->

### Added

- **`/api/recent-sent`:** Returns up to **15** successful forwards sorted by **`ts` descending** (true “latest” first). In-memory `RECENT_SENT` holds up to 50. UI badges the top row as “Latest”. Fixes the old `maxlen=1` case where only the **last** unroll shard survived vs Live Events (first alert summary).
- **Custom source JSON:** Multiple stacked sample rows (`+ Add JSON sample`, up to 8); **Use as source fields** merges parsed paths from every non-empty row into one Source field list (unique paths) for mapping dropdowns.
- **Pattern mapping fallbacks:** Optional `source_field_ids` array on each mapping row — ordered source paths; the engine uses the first **non-empty** value (skips `null` and blank strings), then falls back to the first path that exists. Builds `TransformConfig.coalesce_sources` for Alertmanager payloads where `alerts[0]` vs `commonLabels` / `groupLabels` differ.
- **Field Mapper UI:** Per target row, **Source columns 1…n** (horizontal): numbered badges, field `<select>`s (same merged list), **+** inserts a column after that slot, **−** removes a column (minimum one), up to 12 columns — first non-empty value left-to-right wins. **Custom** mode: checkboxes to merge **OCP Alertmanager** and/or **Confluent** preset fields into every dropdown. Save/Apply sends `source_field_ids` when multiple options are set; loading restores from pattern or route `coalesce_sources`.
- **Mapper safety / design:** In-page hint explains option order and merge behavior; **duplicate path in the same target row** blocks Save/Apply with row highlight; **Load pattern (Custom)** auto-enables OCP/Confluent merge when saved paths reference preset fields not present in the pasted custom list.

### Fixed

- **Field Mapper:** `tr is not a function` when adding source options — DOM row variables named `tr` shadowed the i18n helper `tr()`; renamed to `rowEl` in `mapperSetOptionRowCount`, `onMapperAddSrcOptClick`, and `setMappingsToForm`.
- **Field Mapper:** `+ Add source option` click handler is attached even when `/api/pattern-schemas` fails (e.g. Basic Auth not ready yet); previously the listener only ran after a successful schema fetch.
- **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico` and `<link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.svg">` to stop 404 noise in the console.
- **DLQ table:** **HTTP** and **Unroll** headers/cells had been left in `index.html` and `renderDlqTable` after the earlier column removal — stripped again; detail row `colspan` aligned (`DLQ_TABLE_COLS = 8`).

### Changed

- **Outbound target probes / logs:** `httpx` and `httpcore` loggers default to WARNING so health probes no longer print one INFO JSON line per HTTP request. **Target status cache** default TTL raised from 12s to **30s** (`ALERTBRIDGE_TARGET_STATUS_CACHE_SEC`) to reduce how often each forward URL is probed (GET + POST per active route per refresh).
- **POST `/api/patterns/apply` (form with mappings):** Requires an existing saved pattern — `pattern_name` must match a library row (Save first). Apply updates the route transform only; it no longer auto-creates or updates the pattern library on apply. Optional `pattern_id` must match that name.
- **DLQ table:** Removed **HTTP** and **Unroll** columns to simplify the grid; `http_status`, `unroll_index`, and `unroll_count` remain visible in the row **Detail** JSON.

## [2026-04-02]

### Added

- **Alert severity in UI and API paths:** `extract_alert_severity()` reads severity from Alertmanager-style payloads (`commonLabels`, `groupLabels`, `alerts[].labels`, top-level `labels`, or flat `severity`). Severity is attached to live events, failed events, recent payloads/sent, DLQ rows, and forwarding responses where applicable.
- **Severity column** in Live requests, Failed events, and DLQ tables; badges with color by level (critical / warning / info / low / default).
- **Tests:** `tests/test_alert_extract.py` for severity extraction; persistence tests for **one saved pattern per name** (same name overwrites same id) and **apply-from-form** not duplicating rows.

### Changed

- **Saved patterns:** Saving a pattern with an existing name **updates** that row instead of creating a duplicate (`find_pattern_id_by_name`, `save_pattern` behavior). UI tracks `editorPatternId` so Save/Apply reuse the active or loaded pattern id; `POST /api/patterns/apply` accepts optional `pattern_id` to update the correct row.
- **Field Mapper copy (EN/TH):** Clarified Save vs Apply, single row per pattern name, updated button labels and status strings (`mapperPatternSavedOk`, `mapperApplyStatusLine`, etc.).
- **Active pattern line:** Shows which route the active pattern applies to, with highlighted styling (`.mapper-active-pattern-highlight`).

### Fixed

- **DLQ Unroll tooltip:** Tooltip text now uses the **actual** unroll fraction (`{i}/{n}`) for that row instead of a fixed `1/2` example; separate hint for cells showing `—`.
